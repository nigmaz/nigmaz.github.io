                            ATTENTION Egyptair
                        YOUR NETWORK HAS BEEN COMPROMISED
================================================================================

Dear Egyptair Management,

Your corporate network has been successfully infiltrated and encrypted by our 
advanced ransomware system. All critical business data, including:

• Financial records and accounting databases
• Customer information and contact lists  
• Employee personal data and HR records
• Proprietary software and source code
• Business contracts and legal documents
• Email archives and communication logs
• Backup systems and recovery files

...have been ENCRYPTED and are currently INACCESSIBLE.

================================================================================
                                WHAT HAPPENED?
================================================================================

Our team has gained complete access to your network infrastructure through 
sophisticated penetration techniques. We have:

1. Encrypted all critical business files using military-grade encryption
2. Exfiltrated sensitive data as insurance against non-payment
3. Disabled your backup and recovery systems
4. Maintained persistent access to your network

Your current security measures were insufficient to prevent this breach.

================================================================================
                              RECOVERY OPTIONS
================================================================================

You have TWO options to recover your data:

OPTION 1: Pay the ransom fee of $500,000 USD in Bitcoin
- Fast and guaranteed recovery of all encrypted files
- Deletion of all exfiltrated data from our servers
- Complete removal of our access from your systems
- Detailed security report to prevent future breaches

OPTION 2: Attempt recovery without payment
- Risk permanent data loss
- Potential public release of sensitive information
- Continued vulnerability to future attacks
- Significant business disruption and downtime
